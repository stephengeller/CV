## About me

A recent graduate in Psychology from the University of Sheffield, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in technology where I could be creative and engaged on a daily basis, and so I began investigating the world of software development to see if it would be appropriate for me.

After experimenting with the fundamentals of object-oriented design and basic methods, I committed to a new exciting career choice in software development and applied to [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), where I learnt a broad range of skills.

I have loved learning to create functional and diverse apps throughout the course and in my free time, and have benefited from it in terms of employing test-driven development, communicating code through pairing and improving my independent learning techniques.


## Skills

#### Confident communicator

During my time at the University of Sheffield's Theatre Company ([SuTCo](http://www.sutco.org/)), I held many roles reliant on clear and confident communication in order to achieve goals work efficiently. The most significant role held was the one of Technical Manager for the entire society.

This senior role comprised of heading technical activity for the society, and managed operations in over 10 independent productions per year with at least 100 active members. All formal communications with hired venues, arrangements of technical training sessions and technical investment decisions were helmed by me throughout tenancy of the position.
These responsibilities required extensive communication skills, in order to facilitate interactions between official businesses (such as theatres), production teams and the senior committee.

I held other roles within SuTCo, including:
- Sound Designer (5 shows)
- Production Manager (Damage by Ben Price, November 2015)
- Stage Manager (Festival of New Writing, April 2015)

Due to my work in the role I was voted SuTCo's "Techie of the Year" award by my peers at the end-of-year awards event.


#### Decisive, thorough thinker

In 2017, I participated in charity hitch-hike ([Bummit](bummit.co.uk)) from Sheffield to Riga, Latvia, all whilst trying to spend as little money as possible. We were tasked with hitching transport across England, then through Europe to reach our destination within ten days.

As a group of three, we had to make confident decisions as to what route we should take throughout Europe, how to approach strangers and where to go within cities we arrived in, all whilst learning to speak unfamiliar new languages. This developed decision-making skills, confidence and support skills for my fellow team-mates during challenging times.

Using these skills, we arrived in Riga within our time-limit, having covered 1,600 miles, 9 cities and 6 countries.


#### Problem solver

While working for Healthcare at Home, I assisted clients in arranging deliveries of needed medication to their homes. Many clients were elderly, and some had negative experiences with the service in the past, and so contacting them often resulted in them expressing grievances.

As a coordinator, I dealt with these grievances as professionally as possible, ensuring the client felt reassured with the quality of the company's service by the end of the phone call, whilst also comforting them if they were distressed. Within a short amount of time, I was designated as the 'problem solver', and would be selected to deal with any customer grievances whenever they occured.

This led to me being promoted into a supervisory role for the team, which involved overseeing customer service experience for over eighty staff members.
