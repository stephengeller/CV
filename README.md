## About me

A recent graduate in Psychology from the University of Sheffield, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in technology where I could be creative and engaged on a daily basis, and so I began investigating the world of software development to see if it would be appropriate for me.

After experimenting with the fundamentals of object-oriented design and basic methods, I committed to a new exciting career choice in software development and applied to [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), where I learnt a broad range of skills.

I have loved learning to create functional and diverse apps throughout the course and in my free time, and have benefited from it in terms of employing test-driven development, communicating code through pairing and improving my independent learning techniques.


## Skills

#### Strong communicator

During my time with the University of Sheffield's Theatre Company ([SuTCo](http://www.sutco.org/)), I held the role of Technical Manager, which was reliant on clear and confident communication in order to achieve goals work efficiently.

This senior role comprised of heading technical activity for the society, and managed operations in over 10 independent productions per year with at least 100 active members.

All formal communications with hired venues, arrangements of technical training sessions and technical investment decisions were helmed by me throughout tenancy of the position.

Due to my work in the role I was voted SuTCo's "Techie of the Year" award by my peers at the end-of-year awards event.

###### Other ways where I showed this skill:
  - When working at Healthcare At Home, I was promoted to supervisor, becoming responsible for managing over 80 staff members
  - As production manager of Ben Price's play 'Damage' in 2015, I managed the assembly of music, lighting, props, set and risk assessments through communicating with my production team. The show ran for a week at the [Drama Studio](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cics/performance-venues/whats-on), and won best sound and best show at the end of year SuTCo awards
  - My job at the Sheffield University Student's Union comprised of communicating with student enquiries, responding to questions sent to the main SU email, and helping student societies arrange events and bookings.


#### Decisive and confident

In 2017, I participated in charity hitch-hike ([Bummit](bummit.co.uk)) from Sheffield to Riga, Latvia, all whilst trying to spend as little money as possible. We were tasked with hitching transport across England, then through Europe to reach our destination within ten days.

As a group of three, we had to make confident decisions as to what route we should take throughout Europe, how to approach strangers and where to go within cities we arrived in, all whilst learning to speak unfamiliar new languages.

Using these skills, we arrived in Riga within our time-limit, having covered 1,600 miles, 9 cities and 6 countries. I also raised £335 for the selected charities, and made a (poorly-edited) [video of my experience!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEGBNfc9FT0)


#### Quick learner

I have always been excited by learning new technologies and software, both in music and non music-related areas:

  - Learnt how to use [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/) at 14 years old to record and produce live music, and subsequently learnt [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/) over a few months in order to explore more electronic-based composition.
  - Taught myself to use Traktor Pro, a software used by DJs to perform live.
  - Taught myself [QLab](https://figure53.com/qlab/) so I can design soundscapes and sound effects for theatre productions

I am equally keen on learning new techniques when required by the situation at hand:

  - Without any prior knowledge of how to do them, I began writing risk assessments and method statements for shows involving casts and crews of over 30 people
  - During 'Damage', I learnt how to manage a small £400 budget to provide necessary funds for purchasing all set items
