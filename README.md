## Stephen Geller

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

I am currently a budding web developer, attending the July cohort of Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive development bootcamp. A recent graduate in Psychology from the University of Sheffield (1st Class), I am looking to find a job in the tech industry, and am currently open-minded to the specifics of what that will be.
