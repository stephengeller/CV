## Stephen Geller

I am a budding web developer, attending the July cohort of Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive development bootcamp. A recent graduate in Psychology from the University of Sheffield (1st Class), I am looking to find a job in the tech industry following completion of the bootcamp in October. I am currently open-minded to the specifics of what that will be, and happy to explore new areas.

## Skills

#### Communication

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

During my time at the University of Sheffield's Theatre Company ([SuTCo](http://www.sutco.org/)), I held many roles reliant on clear and confident communication in order to achieve goals work efficiently.

###### Technical Manager (SuTCo, 2015 - 2016)
This role comprised of being the head of technical activity for the society, overseeing affairs in over 10 independent productions per year with over 100 active members. All formal communications with hired venues, arrangements of technical training sessions and technical investment decisions were helmed by me throughout tenancy of the position. These responsibilities required extensive communication skills, in order to facilitate interactions between official businesses (such as theaters), production teams and the senior committee.

Other responsibilities within SuTCo included:
- Sound Designer (5 shows)
- Production Manager (Damage by Ben Price)

Due to my work in the role I was voted SuTCo's "Techie of the Year" award by my peers at the end-of-year awards event.
