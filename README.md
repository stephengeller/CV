I am an ambitious full-stack web developer based in London, UK. I pick up new skills very quickly, and can produce clean tested code following best practices. I have previous experience working in large technical teams, and have managed technical work in theatre productions.

I am a graduate from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) - a 12-week intensive development bootcamp - and am currently employed at [The Guardian](https://gu.com) as a Software Engineer, specialising in tools and infrastructure.


I love learning a diverse range of technologies both through my work and experimentation, and consistently endorse Agile methodologies and XP values to help me grow my skills.

#### Quick learner

I have always been excited by learning new technologies and software, both in music and non music-related areas:
  - Learnt how to use [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/) at 14 years old to record and produce live music, and subsequently learnt [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/) over a few months in order to explore more electronic-based composition.
  - Taught myself to use [Traktor Pro](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/traktor/dj-software/traktor-pro-2/), a software used by DJs to perform live.
  - Taught myself [QLab](https://figure53.com/qlab/) so I can design soundscapes and sound effects for theatre productions

I am equally keen on learning new techniques when required by the situation at hand:
  - Without any prior knowledge of how to do them, I taught myself to write thorough risk assessments and method statements for shows involving casts and crews of over 30 people.
  - During 'Damage' - explained below - I learnt how to manage a small £400 budget to provide necessary funds for purchasing all set items

#### Strong communicator

- During my time with the University of Sheffield's Theatre Company ([SuTCo](http://www.sutco.org/)), I held the role of Technical Manager, which comprised of heading technical activity for the society, and managed operations in over 10 independent productions per year with over 200 active members.
- All formal communications with hired venues, arrangements of technical training sessions and technical investment decisions were helmed by me throughout tenancy of the position.
- Due to my work in the role I was voted SuTCo's "Techie of the Year" award by my peers at the end-of-year awards event.

###### Other ways where I showed this skill:
  - When working at Healthcare At Home, I was promoted to supervisor by my manager, becoming responsible for managing communication between over 80 staff members
  - As production manager of Ben Price's play 'Damage' in 2015, I managed the assembly of music, lighting, props, set and risk assessments through communicating with my production team. The show ran for a week at the [Drama Studio](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cics/performance-venues/whats-on), and won both best sound and best show at the end-of-year SuTCo awards.

#### Decisive and confident

- In 2017, I participated in a charity hitch-hike ([Bummit](bummit.co.uk)) from Sheffield to Riga, Latvia, all whilst trying to spend as little money as possible. We were tasked with reaching our destination within ten days.
- As a group of three, we had to make confident decisions as to what route we should take throughout Europe, how to approach strangers and where to go within cities we arrived in, all whilst learning to speak unfamiliar new languages.
- Using these skills, we arrived in Riga within our time-limit, having covered 1,600 miles, 9 cities and 6 countries. I also raised £335 for the selected charities, and made a (poorly-edited) video of my experience (DM for details)!
