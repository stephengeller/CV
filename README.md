## Stephen Geller

I am currently a budding web developer, attending the July cohort of Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive development bootcamp. A recent graduate in Psychology from the University of Sheffield (1st Class), I am looking to find a job in the tech industry following completion of the bootcamp in October. I am currently open-minded to the specifics of what that will be, and happy to explore new areas.
